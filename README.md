# CMPE462 - Machine Learning Assignment 1
## Part 1: Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)
### Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
### Data
Data is under the "pla_data" directory which is in the same directory as the script.
### Running the Code
The script can be run with the following command: python3 pla.py
### Output
The script runs the PLA algorithm on both small and large datasets with 10 different random weight initializations and reports various information on the file stats.txt. The file stats.txt contains detailed information on the calculations for the small dataset like initial and final weights, number of iterations for convergence, the accuracy on test data and the equation of the decision boundary. It also reports the average number of iterations for convergence and the average accuracy for both datasets.

## Part 2: Logistic Regression
### Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- time
- argparse
- math
### Data
Data is under the "logistic_regression_data" directory which is in the same directory as the script.
### Running the Code
### Output

## Part 3: Naive Bayes
### Dependencies
- math
### Data
Data is under the "breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic" directory which is in the same directory as the script.
### Running the Code
The script can be run with the following command:
```python3 naive_bayes.py```
### Output
The script prints out the train accuracy and test accuracy of the naive Bayes classifier.
